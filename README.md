### :wave: Hi, I'm Anthony !

I am a software engineer working in the data space. 

Here are some things I've done : 

**1. Educated SWEs on building streaming data pipelines**

Check out this YouTube video of my conference [workshop](https://youtu.be/4lwspjbJg7I?feature=shared) on building a streaming data pipeline using Apache Beam. The code for the conference workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/ant-laz/streamingworkshop) and a cool viz tool for the pipeline output can be found [here](https://github.com/ant-laz/streamingworkshopviz) . 

**2. Educated SWEs on building batch data pipelines**

Check out my [tutorial](https://github.com/ant-laz/batchworkshop-python) on building a batch data pipeline using Apache Beam.

**3. Educated SWEs on writing performant SQL**

See my [codelab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/30937) on optimising SQL query performance in BigQuery.

See my [codelab](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/catalog_lab/31049) on optimising the cost of data tables in BigQuery.

**4. Built tools for SWEs who work with Apache Airflow**

Take a look at my CLI tool [cloudcomposerdiff](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/composer-utilities/tree/main/cloudcomposerdiff) for Airflow (Cloud Composer).
